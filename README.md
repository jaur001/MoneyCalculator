# Money Calculator

This application calculates the exchange rate from one currency to other one. The user writes an amount, the currency of the money and the currency to change as an input and receives the total amount of that output. The list of exchanges rates is obtained by the REST web service [Currency Converter API](https://www.currencyconverterapi.com/).
